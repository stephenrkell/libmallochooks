What are our basic test cases?

Let's use the Cartesian product of the following variables.

- where is the malloc?  { built exe, built DSO, libc DSO }

- where is the caller?  { same obj,  other obj, libc (use strdup) }

How do we lump these?

- each test case has one malloc, all three callers... cases differ on where the
malloc is

- the test case is just to run some code in the exe, some code in
the DSO, and some code that calls the C library such that it will
call malloc from all three places

- ideally we would do a round-robin, though no libc function will free (except
__libc_free which we *don't* want)

More advanced test cases:

+ maybe cleverer cases with aliases, e.g. model __libc_malloc

+ test hook composition
